# QTLseqr

QTLseqr is an R package for QTL mapping using Bulk Segregant Analysis.

The package is an R implementation of the analysis described in
The Statistics of Bulk Segregant Analysis Using Next Generation Sequencing 
Magwene PM, Willis JH, Kelly JK (2011) The Statistics of Bulk Segregant Analysis Using Next Generation Sequencing. PLOS Computational Biology 7(11): e1002255. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002255

It also incorperates ΔSNP-index type analysis as described by Takagi, Hiroki, et al. "QTL‐seq: rapid mapping of quantitative trait loci in rice by whole genome resequencing of DNA from two bulked populations." The Plant Journal 74.1 (2013): 174-183.
